def main():

    # conditional flow uses if, elif, else
    # if x < y:
    #     result = "x is less than y"
    # elif x == y:
    #     result = "x is the same as y"
    # else:
    #     result = "x is greater than y"
    # print(result)

    # conditional statements let you use "a if C else b"
    # result = "x is less than y" if x < y else "x is greater or equal to y"
    # print(result)

    # match-case makes it easy to compare multiple values 
    value = "eight"
